The codes in this repository can be used to reproduce the results in the paper

P. Mozgunov & T. Jaki "A Flexible Design for Advanced Phase I/II Clinical Trials with Continuous Efficacy Endpoints"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file "main-code" implements the proposed design. This code should be run first.

The file "performance in single-agent scenarios.R" can be used to reproduce the operating characteristics of the proposed design (WE design) in the single-agent scenarios 1-6 provided in Table 2.

The file "performance in dual-agent scenarios.R" can be used to reproduce the operating characteristics of the proposed design (WE design) in the dual-agent scenarios 7-9 provided in Table 3.
